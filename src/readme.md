<h1 align="center">üêà Find A Cat</h1>

## About
Find A Cat is a web application based on Laravel to help people find and manage cats, cat pedigrees and calculate inbreeding of cat pairs to determine if mating is a good idea. Please read my thesis to get a better idea about the functionality and intentions behind this application. My thesis includes a guide on how to setup an admin account by flagging it as such in the database after registration.

## Features
This application uses English, Slovak and supports multiple languages.
