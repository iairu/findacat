## Overview

Find A Cat is a web application based on Laravel to help people find and manage cats, cat pedigrees, and calculate inbreeding of cat pairs to determine if mating is a good idea. Please read my thesis to get a better idea about the functionality and intentions behind this application. My thesis includes a guide on how to set up an admin account by flagging it as such in the database after registration.
